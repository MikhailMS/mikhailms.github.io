One of my projects required me to collect system metrics of the remote machine, so I decided to write some Bash scripts to do so. 
Obviously I could have use some packages for it, but decided to 'reinvent the wheel' because:
1. I wanted to practise Bash
2. I could be in control of how it works and what metrics are being collected
3. I could make it as lightweight as possible
4. It is a bit sad to install super duper package and only use 1% of it

**_Tested on MacOs 10.13 High Sierra, Centos 7_**
