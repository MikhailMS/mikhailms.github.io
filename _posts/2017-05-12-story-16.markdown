Aim of the project was to build mobile application and API, which together would enable people to search football related tweets on Twitter.
Project was a given to a team of 3 (myself included) and I was responsible for building initial version of API (enabling Sockets) and building mobile application.

**Application is build upon Twitter Search & Streaming API, to allow you to search for various tweets published on twitter.com in real-time**
**Application is more focused on football players and clubs, so it would provide extra information about players and clubs, but not, apparently, limited by that**

**List of modules that've been created, in order to complete the application:**

- [x] Querying Twitter Search & Streaming APIs':
    - [x] Players, e.g. using their names, Twitter screen names or a range of selected keywords or hashtags
    - [x] Football teams using their names
    - [x] Authors of tweets
- [x] Output fetched tweets in user-friendly manner
    - [x] Return a list of 300 tweets ( or less, if there are no 300 tweets)
    - [x] For each tweet provide following:
        - [x] Author, text, time and date
        - [x] the link to the original message and
        - [x] a link to the authorâ€™s page
- [x] Store data in database
    - [x] Database should be used as source of data
    - [x] Database should be used as a cache to reduce number of queries sent to Twitter API
- [x] Build a mobile application with Apache Cordova
- [x] Integrate information retrieved from DBPedia (data about clubs and/or players)


**_Project's API has been tested manually, mobile app was tested on Nexus 5 - Android 7.1.2._**
