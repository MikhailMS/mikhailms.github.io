I have seen this challenge in my emails and decided to take part. So I searched for a right partner in my course group and one lad decided to join my team. Together, by using Python + neurolab package and our knowledge from university course we dived into it. First stage we completed with an error 15.76%, second stage - 10.15%. However then university projects took a lead and we decided to drop this challenge, and focused on them. However we agreed to complete this challenge next year, as our result throughout the challenge was in top-10.
