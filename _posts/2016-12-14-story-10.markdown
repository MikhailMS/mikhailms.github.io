I have seen this challenge in my emails and decided to take part. 

So I've decided tp coop with one of my coursemate, who found this challenge of some interest to him.
Together, by using Python + neurolab package and our knowledge from university course, we dived straight into the challenge. 
First stage we completed with an error 15.76%, second stage - 10.15%. 

Unfortunately for both of us, at the last stage of the challenge university projects took a lead and we decided to drop from competition. 

**BUT** we agreed to complete this challenge next year, as our result throughout the challenge was in top-10.
