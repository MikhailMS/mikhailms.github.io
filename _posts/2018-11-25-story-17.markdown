After I joined BT I was acknowledged that I need to learn Java 8 for upcoming projects.

So I decided to build a simple application which simulates a shop, where you can look for available goods, order them and etc. 
Also, to make it more interesting, I build GUI for the application in JavaFX, which seems to be the only package for GUI that is being maintained. 


Moreover, because my team uses TDD approach for building software, I tried to practice that as well in this project. 

As little extra, this project is my first time when I used CI and tools to keep my code clean and ensure it follows best practices.

**_Build and tested on MacOS and Java 1.8 (required)_**
