Everyone is familiar with data visualisation tools. However, what if we were able to represent data in musical form?

Project aims to use modern techniques for text analysis, music generation and neural networks to reach the goal - design and develop the system that would be capable to map features, extracted from the text, onto music in order to control its parameters. System could be used for generating background music for audio books.

Since there are number of features that may be extracted from music and the text, and lots of ways to map them with each other, extensive trial would be conducted once below modules are build to identify most suitable approach.

**List of modules that would be created, in order to complete the application, in the priority order:**

- [x] ~~Music input~~ - more functionality should be added, since at the moment text features are not taken into account

- [ ] Music analysis

- [ ] Text analysis - **currently in progress**

- [x] ~~Building neural network~~ - *80% completeness. Possibly some changes would be made to network after text features would be added for analysis*

- [x] ~~Music output~~ - *100% completeness*

- [ ] Text mapping

**_Application is build with Python 2.7_**
