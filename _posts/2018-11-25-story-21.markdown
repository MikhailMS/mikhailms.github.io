Initially I wrote this Python app to help me with developing Java plugin for internal BT project. 
This app was extremelly helpfull cause it could sync my local files onto remote testing machines (or in our case local vagrant development environment)

As of now this project been developed further in our team as it is required in one of the current project. Once it is done and I confirm nothing in the app is to be considered private to the company,
i will publish it in my private repo.


**_Currently this project is in further development and been rewritten for Python 3.6+_**
