This assignment was my first game I completed at decent level. While assignment aim was to practice topics, covered in semester 1, I tried to use advanced features of Ruby to make my game as efficient as possible. Start date - 2.12.2014, End date - 15.12.2014,
Module - Introduction in Software Engineering.
