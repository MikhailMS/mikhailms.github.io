I have built a team with my coursemate to take a part in this 24 hours Game Jam. It was my first experience in such an events, however I was ready to face any challenges. At the beginning of the event we decided to take 2 more guys into team, so after that our team started to think about the game - the topic was “End of the world”. After Jam finished we had a fully functional game (2D platformer). To achieve this goal we use LibGDX library.
