During my time in Sixth Form at Warminster School I obtained following grades:
Math (A), Russian (A*), Further Math (D), Physics (D).

Besides putting lots of effort in studies, I've been a member of 1st Football team,
studied guitar and been a part of CCF (Combat Cadet Force) where I got a Lance Corporal rank.
