I have joined a team of graduates from Sheffield Hallam University. 
They asked me to produce an android application for their project, so I decided to take this opportunity to test my abilities in Java and solving challenges 
as Iâ€™ve never tried to code a mobile applications. 

Over the summer I worked in collaboration with a team in order to produce the great app.
I have learned Android Development from the scratch by watching course provided by Google Android team. After the course I was able to build a decent application. 

By the end of the summer I had a working prototype that was accepted by the team, so currently I am working on improvements.
Unlucky for me, at the moment project is frozen due luck of initiative from the rest of the team.
