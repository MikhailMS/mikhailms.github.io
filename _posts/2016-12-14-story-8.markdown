I have joined a team of graduates from Sheffield Hallam University. They asked me to produce an android application for their project, so I decided to take this opportunity to test my abilities in Java and solving challenges as Iâ€™ve never tried to code a mobile applications. Over the summer I worked in collaboration with a team in order to produce the great app. I have learned Android Development from the scratch by watching course provided by Google Android team. After the course I was able to build a decent application. By the end of the summer I had a working prototype that was accepted by the team, so currently I am working on improvements.
