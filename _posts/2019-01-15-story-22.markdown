In my main work project it was required to build API which can get data from ElasticSearch.
So, my initial approach was to use really nice package https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py which allows a nice way to work with ES from your Python code.

However, later on I reallised this package does not support asyncronous calls to ElasticSearch and my project could not co-op with incoming load.
So I started to look into how we can use async approach. There exist package (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-py-async) which enables async calls to ES.
But because this package does not have nice wrappers aroung calls and ES response as in dsl package and because initial dsl package was already higly integrated into the code,
I decided to write my own module, which apparently an update for the code from dsl package, but with the use of async ES client. 

As a result, it gave us a significant improvement - now we can handle 3 times more request than with default dsl package.
