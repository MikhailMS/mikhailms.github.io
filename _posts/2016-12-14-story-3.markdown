The idea of the project was to teach us to work in pairs on a task that was not covered on lectures.

In the nutshell, task was as simple as it sounds - code the robot so it follows the black line on the floor and avoid obstacles on its way.
However, what we found to be the biggest challenge - how to make software and hardware work as we wanted.
It took a bit of a time to figure out the right parameters so robot behaves right. 
As extra bit we made our robot to dance and sing Christmas song (“We wish you a Merry Christmas”) when it completes the task.
