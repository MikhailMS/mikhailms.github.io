I have joined BT almost 1.5 years ago and so far it was a great experience.
Ever since I joined I was involved into real project unlike most of the grad roles.

From the day 1 my responsibles were:
1. Develop the system for collecting data from internal servers (Apache Flume)
2. Develop the system for aggregating and distributing collected data (Apache Kafka)
3. Develop an API for exposing access to our data sources to internal & external teams (Python 3.6 + asyncio)
4. Maintaining and improving the current products of our team
5. Keep all our development environments, plugins and scripts up-to-date.
5. Deployment of the application and products:
6. Maintane the production servers for non-critical systems:

From time to time our team receives tasks from other team to build software for them, so we never stop learning and developing. For example:
1. We have build web based application for network events predictions - JavaScript for server and user interaction + Python for machine learning and prediction
2. Testing coverage tool for Nokia DSL. Written in Kotlin
