Back in the days our team got a brand new shiny Macbooks, so I decided to write a bunch of Bash scripts which would check what is currently installed on the machine
and install all missing packages, SDKs and etc. 

In another words, it would install all the tools that are heavilly used by me or our team.


Moreover, it was a great help for our summer interns that received new laptots without anything installed on them. It saved them quite some time :)
